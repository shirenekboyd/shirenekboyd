### Hi there, I'm Shirene ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Wife, Mother, and Developer!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a Fictional University website as a capstone project for a course I'm taking in hopes of being proficient in PHP and utilizing the power of WordPress to potentially become a freelance developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the steps to build WordPress websites using custom themes and plugins and documenting my journey on my [blog](https://shireneboyd.hashnode.dev/discovering-wordpress-my-learning-journey). I'm also continually honing my Python and Django skills and knowledge since my previous company's platform was built using Django.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project, it would be amazing to find another dev that wants to be on this WordPress journey with me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love being in nature and one of my favorite places to visit is Yellowstone National Park.
