## Hi there, I'm Shirene 👋

👩‍💻 About Me: I’m a dedicated Developer, loving Wife, and proud Mother! My journey in tech spans several programming languages, with recent focuses on Python and Django, complemented by a growing expertise in PHP and WordPress.

🔭 Current Projects: I'm currently engaged in building a Fictional University website as a capstone project. This initiative is part of my transition toward becoming a proficient PHP developer and potentially exploring freelance opportunities with WordPress.

🌱 I’m Learning: I'm actively learning how to craft engaging WordPress websites using custom themes and plugins. Alongside this, I document my learning process on my blog and continuously sharpen my Python and Django skills.

👯 Collaboration: I’m on the lookout to partner with fellow developers who are passionate about WordPress. If you're embarking on a similar path, let’s connect and explore how we can collaborate!

⚡ Fun Fact: I’m an avid nature enthusiast—Yellowstone National Park is one of my favorite retreats!
